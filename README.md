# Recipe API

This project consists of a backend built with **NestJS** and a frontend built with **Next.js**.

## Running the Backend (NestJS)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The backend will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default.

## Running the Frontend (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default (or another port if configured).

## Notes

- Ensure both servers are running for full functionality.
- Update API URLs in the frontend if the backend runs on a different port or host.
